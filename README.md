# flight-delay-analysis
A data analyst project using R and Tableau to explore and visualize U.S. flight delay performance

---

## 📊 Tools Used
- **R**: Data cleaning, exploration, modeling  
- **Tableau**: Interactive dashboards and visualizations  
- **Google Drive**: large Tableau files

---

## 🛠 Project Overview

- Dataset: December 2022 U.S. domestic flight data
- Objective: Analyze flight delays, identify key patterns, and build a predictive model
- End Goal: Use insights to visualize and communicate delay trends.

---

## 🔧 Data Cleaning 
- Removed or handled missing values appropriately
- Created binary flags
- Ensured time fields and categorical variables were properly formatted

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed delays by airline, airport, and day of the week
- Created visual summaries using `ggplot2` and `dplyr`
- Investigated relationships between flight distance, time, and delay probability

---

## 🔮 Predictive Modeling
- Built a **logistic model** to predict if a flight is delayed or not.
- Used key features: airline, departure delay, day of week, departure time
- Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Interpreted model coefficients to understand the influence of features on delays

---

## 📊 Tableau Dashboards
Built interactive dashboards in Tableau to visualize:
- Delay patterns by airport and airline
- Delay Causes by airline
- Departure vs. arrival delay distribution
